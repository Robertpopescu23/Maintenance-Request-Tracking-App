## 📁 Project Directory Structure

Below is a detailed explanation of each file and folder included in this project:

| File/Folder | Description |
|--------------|--------------|
| **.dart_tool/** | Auto-generated by Flutter and Dart. Stores tool, package, and build information. *(Do not modify manually)* |
| **.idea/** | Project configuration for IntelliJ IDEA / Android Studio. Contains settings and workspace info. |
| **android/** | Native Android code and configuration files (Gradle build scripts, manifests). Required for building and running on Android devices. |
| **ios/** | Native iOS project folder containing Xcode files and Info.plist configuration. |
| **lib/** | The core source folder for all Dart code — including UI, logic, models, services, and widgets. |
| **linux/** | Platform-specific files for building and running on Linux. |
| **macos/** | Platform-specific files for macOS builds. |
| **windows/** | Platform-specific files for Windows desktop builds. |
| **web/** | Configuration and entry point for running the app in a web browser. |
| **test/** | Contains unit and widget tests for verifying app behavior. |
| **.gitignore** | Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore in version control. |
| **.metadata** | Metadata used internally by Flutter tools to identify project properties. |
| **analysis_options.yaml** | Defines static analysis and linting rules for Dart code quality. |
| **maintenance_request_app.iml** | IDE configuration file for Android Studio/IntelliJ project management. |
| **pubspec.yaml** | Main configuration file that defines dependencies, assets, fonts, and environment settings. |
| **pubspec.lock** | Auto-generated file that locks dependency versions for consistency across builds. |
| **README.md** | Project documentation file (this one). |

## 🧱 Suggested Custom Folder Structure (Inside `lib/`)

You can organize your `lib/` directory as follows for scalability and clarity:

```
lib/
 ├─ main.dart                # Entry point of the app
 ├─ models/                  # Data models (e.g., User, MaintenanceRequest)
 ├─ screens/                 # App screens (Home, Login, RequestForm, Dashboard)
 ├─ widgets/                 # Reusable UI widgets (Buttons, Cards, Forms)
 ├─ services/                # Firebase and local database interaction logic
 ├─ utils/                   # Constants, helpers, and configuration files
 └─ assets/                  # (Optional) images, icons, fonts, or videos
```

Each folder serves a unique purpose:
- **models/** → defines your data structure  
- **screens/** → contains each app page  
- **widgets/** → reusable UI components  
- **services/** → handles Firebase, APIs, or local DB logic  
- **utils/** → shared utilities, theme, or constants

## 🔗 Planned Integrations

| Integration | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Firebase** | For authentication, cloud database (Firestore), and storage. |
| **Local Database** | Hive or Sqflite for offline caching and persistence. |
| **UI/UX Styling** | Material Design and custom themes for modern look and feel. |

---

## 🧩 Development Roadmap

1. **Design the UI** — build main screens and navigation flow.  
2. **Integrate Firebase** — authentication, Firestore, and cloud functions.  
3. **Implement Local Database** — enable offline support.  
4. **Add Styling & Theming** — apply consistent color palette and responsive design.  
5. **Testing & Optimization** — write unit and widget tests, then optimize performance.

## 🔥 Firebase Integration Guide

### 1. Create a Firebase Project
- Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- Click **“Add Project”** → name it *Maintenance Request App*
- Disable Google Analytics (optional) and click **Create Project**

### 2. Register Your App
In your Firebase console:
- Click **Add app** → choose **Android**, **iOS**, or **Web**
- For Android, use your app’s package name (found in `android/app/build.gradle`)
- Download the generated `google-services.json` file and place it inside:  
  `android/app/`
- For iOS, download `GoogleService-Info.plist` and place it in:  
  `ios/Runner/`

### 3. Add Firebase SDK
Add the Firebase packages in your `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: ^3.0.0
  cloud_firestore: ^5.0.0
  firebase_auth: ^5.0.0
```

Then run:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Initialize Firebase in Your App
Edit your `lib/main.dart` file:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'firebase_options.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp(
    options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
  );
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

### 5. Enable Services in Firebase Console
- **Authentication** → Email/Password or Google Sign-In  
- **Cloud Firestore** → Create database (production mode recommended)  
- **Storage** → Enable for file uploads (e.g., images or videos)
